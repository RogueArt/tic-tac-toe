Tic Tac Toe game made with HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS.

Features (WIP):
- Can expand the grid to any size
- Allows for two players to play against each other
- Automatic checking + resetting

Features to be implemented:
- AI with Minimax Tic Tac Toe algorithm
- Change rows field to change the number of rows (without having to modify the variable directly in the code)
- Use Vue or React instead of Vanilla JS
